## Project Name & Pitch
Team-GA-Redback

This is a software project of subject COMP90082 at The University of Melbourne. Through this project, a user with a Garmin watch can receive a workout via the CoachingMate platform. When they complete their workout, they are able to send the data from the watch to the Dashboard for viewing by themselves and their coach. In this project, the final product of our team is to achieve transferring data from Garmin watches to the CoachingMate backend by using the Garmin APIs, using the Garmin developer resources.
