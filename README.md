## Project Name & Pitch
Team-GA-Redback

This is a software project of subject COMP90082 at The University of Melbourne. Through this project, a user with a Garmin watch can receive a workout via the CoachingMate platform. When they complete their workout, they are able to send the data from the watch to the Dashboard for viewing by themselves and their coach. In this project, the goals of our team are to design the front-end of Garmin API dashboard and do data visualization from the back-end.
